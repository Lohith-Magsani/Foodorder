# FoodOrder

**FoodOrder** is a full-stack web application built with **React.js** (frontend) and a backend for managing food orders. It offers a responsive UI, efficient state management, and user-friendly form handling, enabling users to browse food items, add them to a cart, and place orders by entering their name and address. ([GitHub][1])


## Features

* Browse a list of food items
* Add items to a shopping cart
* Fill out and submit an order with name and address
* Responsive layout for seamless use on desktop and mobile
* Smooth and efficient state management
* Form handling for a hassle-free checkout experience ([GitHub][1])

---

## Tech Stack

* **Frontend**: React.js (with tools like Vite)
* **Backend**: Order management API (Node.js / Express? Please specify)
* **Styling**: CSS
* **Build Tooling / Configuration**: `vite.config.js` from root directory ([GitHub][1])

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v14+
* [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Lohith-Magsani/Foodorder.git
cd Foodorder

# Install frontend dependencies
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

### Running the App

1. **Start the backend server** (if separate):

   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Start the frontend**:

   ```bash
   cd ../
   npm run dev
   ```

   This should launch the app—often at `http://localhost:3000` or `http://localhost:5173`.

*Update port numbers as appropriate.*
